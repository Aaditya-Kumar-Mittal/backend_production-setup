## 🧾 Introduction

This document explains:

- What CORS is and why it's important
- How Vite handles proxying for development
- Why moving the `dist` folder manually into the backend folder is a **bad practice**
- A **better approach** to integrate frontend and backend efficiently for production deployments

## 🔐 What is CORS?

**CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** is a security mechanism enforced by browsers to restrict HTTP requests initiated from scripts running in the browser to different origins (domains/ports/protocols) than the page itself.

### 🔍 What is a "cross-origin" request?

| Scenario                                          | Cross-Origin? |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Different domain (a.com vs b.com)                 | ✅ Yes        |
| Different port (localhost:3000 vs localhost:5000) | ✅ Yes        |
| Different protocol (http vs https)                | ✅ Yes        |

When such a request is made, the browser sends a **preflight request**, and the server must explicitly allow it using **CORS headers**.

---

## 🌐 Cross-Origin Requests

Example in development:

- Frontend runs at `http://localhost:5173` (Vite)
- Backend runs at `http://localhost:5000` (Express)
- This is considered **cross-origin** due to the different port numbers.

To allow it:

```js
// Backend
import cors from "cors";
app.use(cors()); // ✅ call the function
```

---

## 🚀 How Vite Handles Proxying

Instead of allowing CORS in development, Vite allows you to **proxy API requests** to the backend.

### ✅ vite.config.js

```js
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    proxy: {
      "/api": "http://localhost:5000", // Proxies requests to backend
    },
  },
});
```

This makes frontend requests like `fetch('/api/jokes')` work **as if they are on the same origin** — no CORS needed.

---

## ⚙️ Build Process and Output

When you run:

```bash
npm run build
```

Vite:

- Transforms all frontend code (JSX, CSS, assets)
- Outputs a `dist/` folder with pure HTML, CSS, and JS

---

## ❌ Common Mistake: Moving `dist` Into Backend

Many developers:

- Copy `frontend/dist` into the backend project (e.g., `backend/frontend/dist`)
- Serve it using:

```js
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "frontend/dist")));
```

### 🔴 Why this is **wrong**

- Every time the frontend changes, you must **rebuild and recopy** `dist` manually.
- It breaks the separation of concerns.
- It often leads to **stale UIs** in production.
- You lose track of what's current — you’re shipping old code unknowingly.

---

## 🛠️ Recommended Deployment Practice

### ✅ Approach A: Use a Build Script

Create a root-level folder structure:

```folder
/project
  /client   --> React App
  /server   --> Express Backend
```

In `package.json` at the root or backend:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "cd ../client && npm run build",
  "start": "node server.js"
}
```

### ✅ In `server.js`

```js
import path from "path";
import express from "express";

const app = express();

// Serve static files from the React app
app.use(express.static(path.resolve(__dirname, "../client/dist")));

app.get("*", (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.resolve(__dirname, "../client/dist/index.html"));
});
```

> This way, `npm run build` pulls the latest version from frontend automatically.

---

## 📦 Alternative: Host Frontend Separately

Deploy the **frontend** (e.g., on Vercel, Netlify) and the **backend** (e.g., on Render, Railway), then use **CORS** properly in production to allow cross-origin access between domains.

## ✅ Summary

| Bad Practice                      | ✅ Recommended Practice                              |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Manually moving `dist` to backend | Use a build script to integrate or deploy separately |
| Serving stale `dist` files        | Serve fresh builds from CI/CD or scripted builds     |
| Ignoring CORS or proxy setup      | Use `cors()` or Vite proxy during development        |
